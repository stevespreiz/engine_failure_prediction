engine_failure_prediction
==============================

Machine learning based approach to predicting aircraft engine failure. 
Dataset from the [NASA Open Data Portal](https://data.nasa.gov/).

The data [CMAPSS Jet Engine Simulated Data](https://data.nasa.gov/Aerospace/CMAPSS-Jet-Engine-Simulated-Data/ff5v-kuh6) contains several multivariate time series containing engine settings and sensor measurements. 
The time series used for training operate until failure with the quantity of interest being Remaining Useful Life (RUL), the number of cycles until failure.
The test datasets end at some point prior to failure and the goal is to predict the RUL at that point. 
Data is included in this repository for convenience.

Several ML approaches will be tested and compared for effectiveness in predicting on the test data. 

To execute the model:

- Run the script: ./src/data/make_dataset_rnn.py to generate the data
- Execute the model in ./notebooks/5.0-ss-gru-intial.ipynb (more instructions there)
